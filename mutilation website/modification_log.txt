Here is a summary of the steps taken to modify the website. This can be used as a guide for similar tasks in the future.

**Goal:** To separate a specific webpage from its container and remove interactive overlays. The main objective was to disable the click action that swapped between different views/pages and remove the colored rectangular outlines, while preserving the original page's visual styling (like a blur effect on images).

**Methodology:**

1.  **Identify the Correct HTML File:**
    *   The initial analysis showed that the main page was a container using an `<iframe>` to display the actual content. The click actions to swap pages were part of this container.
    *   The core content was located in the HTML file referenced by the `<iframe>`'s `src` attribute.
    *   **Action:** To separate the page, all modifications were performed directly on the `<iframe>`'s source file. This isolates it from the container and ensures all its styling and relative file paths remain intact.

2.  **Analyze and Surgically Edit the CSS:**
    *   The colored outlines (interactive overlays) were traced to a specific stylesheet linked in the content's HTML file.
    *   This CSS file was also responsible for a critical `filter: blur()` effect on an image, which needed to be preserved. Deleting the entire file was not a viable option.
    *   The file also contained a `* { pointer-events: none !important; }` rule, which disabled all click functionality on the page.
    *   **Action:** I edited the specific CSS file to remove only the unwanted rules. Specifically, I deleted the rules that applied outlines and also removed the global `pointer-events` rule. The rule responsible for the blur effect was kept.

3.  **Remove Unwanted JavaScript:**
    *   The content's HTML file contained a `<script>` tag.
    *   This script was found to add a click listener to the page that would interfere with normal functionality by trying to communicate with the parent container frame.
    *   **Action:** I removed the entire `<script>` tag from the HTML to prevent this script from running and interfering with the now standalone page.

**Summary for Future AI:**

To replicate this process on a similar website, follow these general steps:
1.  If the target content is within an `<iframe>`, identify the source HTML file of that frame. The best approach is often to modify this source file directly to make it a standalone page.
2.  Inspect the linked CSS files to find the styles responsible for the visual elements you need to remove (e.g., interactive overlays, outlines).
3.  Instead of deleting an entire CSS file (which may contain desired styles like blur effects), edit it to remove only the specific rules causing the unwanted effect.
4.  Inspect the HTML for `<script>` tags. Analyze their function, especially for scripts that handle clicks or communication between frames (`postMessage`). Remove any scripts that introduce behavior you want to disable.
